# Adam's Zillenial Arch Linux Flavor (AZALF)
HI SISTERS! This will be meant as a need-to-have/wish-list for an endgame Distro/Flavor/Whatever Linux For me. The Endgoal is to be able to create a script that completly automates the install of the script. So if I have to use a gui at any point of the install, I dont care why, I will not be putting it in the script. Now if I get to a desktop enironment and lets say I also endup adding virtualization and will need to use a gui for that fine, but the install *needs* to be able to run automatically in a virtual environment.

## Get Started.

All you will need to get started, is curl... and that is it. This should take care of the rest. Then type: `curl https://github.com/adamkali/azalf.git && cd azalf && sh run.sh`

### Keybindings

[Back to Toc](#table-of-contents)

Any Tiling Window Manager Chad knows that the Keybindings of their TWM is everything to them. The mouse is literally satan and as Luke Smith will tell you they are going to give you aids. You must and I mean *MUST* key your cheeto dust covered hands on the keyboard at all times. How else are you supposed to get the dicord kittens to pay attention to you and own the libtards. So here are the Key Bindings:

## 1. Basic Arch Linux Install

[Back to Toc](#table-of-contents)

Just like the title of this section says this needs to do everything in an Arch Linux install. This will be figuring out how to get to the end of the Arch Linux Install Wiki.

Will generate in the virtual machine. 

## 2. Packages That Are Essential

[Back to Toc](#table-of-contents)

Now this is where we are going to get some packages I know that I will use

### Section 2.1 List of Packages

- 6. Brave Browser.         ==> Gotta have a browser yo. AUR
- 7. OBS                    ==> Streaming so that I can be an ultimate interwebs personality.

### Section 2.2 Ricing list

Like I said before if you want those sweet and savory interweb points you need to have an amazing rice. This is essential because as we all know if you do not have a rice with a tiling window manager, when you harass women as they are sitting there all sexy in the starbucks that you have been staking out for hours they will instantly be able to smell your normy body odor instead of you gigachad musk.

There are three things that we will need first and formost. A display manager, a window manager, and a display server. The ones I have chosen:

- 1. Display Server: XORG   ==> I have no interest for doing more troubleshooting Steam with sway even though I do like Hyperland with
                                those smooth animations. If I know for certain that I could run the games that I need to have [(see 3.1.1)]()

## 3. Applications That Are *NEED TO HAVES*
[Back to Toc](#table-of-contents)

These are things that I know I will need to have or I will consider this whole thing a wash.

### 3.1 List of applications and descriptions


#### 3.1.1 Steam
❌

Play Games :) I want to be able to play these without wine or a VM and have the Ability to launch them from the dashboard that I am planning. Then I want all my save data to just be there. So if not then I will consider everything a wash tbh. I really dont care for running any of the games listed below with wine or any tool like that. And as I will describe later, I want to be able to have my most frequently played games in a dashboard that I can click or use a keybinding for.

- 1. Monster Hunter Rise & World ==> I want to be able to hunt monsters >:(
- 2. Death Stranding             ==> Walking Simulator in 4k
- 3. Elden RIng                  ==> THE LOOOOATHSOME DUNGEATER!
- 4. Stray                       ==> Cute cat game more cyberpunk then cyberpunk 2077 (^=*uu*=^)
- 5. Stardew Valley or Minecraft ==> Why not have a brain turn off game. I don't know what I will choose.

#### 3.1.2 Visual Studio Code
❌

AUR

As I have mentioned before haveing a soy-web-dev job, I do need to have a the ability to work, so I would need things like the ability to write C# painlessly and React/Typescript.

#### 3.1.3 Gimp
❌

Gimp is a perfect photoshop alternative and in my opinion, is better in everyway. I don't know, don't @ me, but I am not dealing with anything else to be honest.

#### 3.1.4 Blender
❌

Blender is an amazing 3D renderer, Video editor, Sculptor and more. I cant get enough of it, and I love getting into it when I can, and eventually I would like to get into game development when I have more time, but for right now It will just be something to look forward to.

#### 3.1.5 Spotify
❌

aur

I want the ability to listen to my podcasts on linux. One thing I would love to have and I will explain later is that I want to have the ability for these things:

- 1. The ability to see the coverart of what I am listening to.
- 2. The ability to skip forward and back and pause.
- 3. The ability to change the voume via system hotkeys.

#### 3.1.6 Launcher
❌

Ulauncher aur

I want the ability to launch something from whatever workspace I am in. And these bullet points are a must:

- 1. I need the ability to press a keybinding and it will give me a search in the middle of the screen.
- 2. If I can get a dashboard workspace working: I need to be able to have the launcher to show up in the dashboard, and dump the
     application in a etc. workspace.
- 3. I need the ability if I open the terminal: I need to have the ability of dumping the opend terminal in the terminal workspace.

#### 3.1.7 Email
❌

thunderbird

This is going to be a tough one to get settled on. I despise almost every email client I have ever seen. Yes, even Luke Smith's Neomutt.
I do not want to spend hours trying to figure out everything and then come back the next day and see that my hardwork is broken. I f I have too I will put on the infinity gauntlet and do it myself. The other end of the spectrum so many Email apications just look bad, or just forget that I just want to check emails. If flair comes at the price of functionality, then you have made a terrible application.

## 4. Applications that would be a nice to have.
❌

[Back to Toc](#table-of-contents)

These are things that would be nice to have, but I would not care if I dont. Like the first one is a messenger to send text messages from my computer. [see 4.1.1](#411-a-text-messengermessaging-aggregate)

### 4.1 List of Applications that would be nice to have.
❌

#### 4.1.1 A Text Messenger/Messaging Aggregate
❌

I want the ablility to be able to send any a text message from my desktop, to a someone on their phone without any problem, or aggregate different messaging apps (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Messanger (oh no I cant spell)) and be able to send those messages.

#### 4.1.2 Overclocking Capabilities
❌
amd-ucode
zenpower3-dkms - AUR
amdctl - AUR
zenstates-git - AUR

This is more like an "I could really live without it" sort of deal. Yes it would be great to squeeze everylast drop of preformance out of my computer but since Linux and Arch are such preformant software it really is a 🤷‍♂️

#### 4.1.3 Google Home Integration
❌




Again this is a 🤷‍♂️ mood, If I can great, if i cant whatever it is more of me being able to do commands from my desktop and have them activate throughout the house, but then again. Reject soyftware, embrace Stalman and his underage discord kittens.

#### 4.1.4 Screen Lock
❌

xlockmore yay

Back to the wishlist that I will spend more time on. I want the abilty to lock the screen when I press: <kbd>LIN</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> to take me to a lock screen that displays the time and if there is music playing, show the audio bar.

#### 4.1.5 An Audio Bar
❌

cava AUR


The audio bar will be the r/unixporn audiobar that i see all the time in widget form. I want it to be in the dashboard. its lowpriorty however as I was not able to get it before.

#### 4.1.6 Analog Clock
❌

I think it would be neat to have a widget like this 🙂 Have the widget in the dashboard, very cozy much warmth 🙂

#### 4.1.7 Task Manager
❌

eww - AUR

No I will not use htop. 🖕  I want to have a widget that displays important things. Like the Lian-Li LConnect dashboard. For example:
- 1. CPU usage %, and temps, no. of cores & threads.
- 2. GPU usage %, temprature, and vram using/total.
- 3. Ram Usage %
- 4. Network Usage %
- 5. Drive Space %
- 6. Most demanding applications.

#### 4.1.8 Notifications
❌

libnotify -> wired -> AUR

I want the ability to get a small notification for a variety of things. Then after 3 seconds I want it to go away.


I want the above to slide in, then slide away after the three seconds are passed. Then I want the progress bar to show up as well, but that is a low priorty as well.

Types of notifications I want to have

- 1. High usage applications. If a process is using too much power, CPU, RAM, I want the ability to see that and kill it. I also want the
     abilty to turn off certain notifications if I cant then I wont implement notifications.
- 2. Messages. See the description above.
- 3. Packages. I want the abilty to see whan a package is done installing from the Package Workspace.
- 4. Updates. When I run sudo pacman -Syyuu --no-confirm from the Package Workspace, I want to get a notification when that is done
     And tell me If I need to reboot.

#### 4.1.9 Virtual Machines
❌

I want the ability to have a Virtual machine that can open in a workspace, and be able to full screen it. Like for example, If I can press <kbd>LIN</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> it will open a workspace for windows and then I can have the option to make it full screen.

### 4.2 Workspaces
❌

I cant stand living without workspaces anymore. Organization of applications and screen realestate has always been the reason why people stay with linux. Once you realize how mediocre they are with other operating systems you just never want to go back.

#### 4.2.1 Dashboard
❌

I want the ability to get into my Dashboard with ease. So my plan is to have the ability a workspace and have its only purpose be to diplay my widgets.

<kbd>LIN</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>

#### 4.2.2 Develpment
[x]

This is obviously the bread and butter of the entire system. This is where you will go for any development or editing. You could even configure this for markdown if you are a gigachad, latex if you are a chad, or I dont know something else. Anyways I want the abilty that anytime that a terminal is opend or an editor is opened it should go here.

There should also be able to open a couple of things:

##### init.vim

Open the vim config. <kbd>LIN</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>

- Shell Binding
```
ev
```

- Actual command
```
nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

##### zshrc or fishrc

Open the shell config <kbd>LIN</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>

- Shell binding
```
ez
```

- Actual command
```

```
    - B. Open .zshrc               ==> [[MOD+SHIFT+Z]]
                                        `$ ez` -> `$ nvim ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc`
    - C. Open .aliases.yaml        ==> [[MOD+SHIFT+A]]
                                        `$ ea` -> `nvim ~/.config/.aliases.yaml`
    - D. Open certain directories  ==> `$ d[First Letter of Each Directory]`
    - E. Reg. Directory alias      ==> Register a directory alias with `$ magister [[req --dir/d]]
                                        [[opt directory]]
                                        [[opt --name/-n ALIAS NAME]]`
    - F. Reg. File alias           ==> Register a file alias with `$ magister [[req --file/f]]
                                        [[opt filename]]
                                        [[opt --name/-n ALIAS NAME]]`
    - G. Open registered files     ==> `$ e[First Letter file unless taken]
    - H. Open Terminal DT          ==> [[MOD+1]] (Yes I know the DT keybinding is at the of the list. I did that
                                        to trigger your O.C.D. anon :) )

- 3. Steam                  ==> One for steam and when a game is playing put it to full screen.
                            [[MOD+2]]
- 4. Spotify                ==> One for spotify
                            [[MOD+3]]
- 5. Email                  ==> Whatever I use I want the ability to open emails ina virtual desktop
                            [[MOD+4]]
- 6. Browser                ==> When ever I open a browser I want the ability to go to this desktop
    - A. Go to Browser DT       ==> [[MOD+5]]
    - B. Open a browser         ==> [[MOD+w]]

- 7. Git                    ==> Have a dedicated desktop for my hooked repos and have them open on login.
                                I want them to be able to open on login and show the current branch.
    - A. Go to Git DT           ==> [[MOD+6]]
    - B. Register a Directory   ==> Register a repository `$ magister [[req --git/g]]
                                    [[opt repository]]
                                    [[opt --name/-n ALIAS NAME]]
                                    {{will initialize if not already}}`
    - C. Add all and commit     ==> `$ gac [[req --message/-m MESSAGE]] [[opt --push/-p ?PUSHING]]`
                                    -> PUSHING
                                        ? `$ git add -A && git commit -am "MESSAGE" && git push`
                                        : `$ git add -A && git commit -am "MESSAGE"`
    - D. Checkout               ==> `$ gco [[opt --init/-i INITIALIZE?]] [[opt --branch/-b BRANCH?]]`
                                    -> BRANCH != null
                                        ? ( INITIALIZE
                                            ? `$ git checkout BRANCH`
                                            : `$ git checkout -b BRANCH`
                                        )
                                        : ` git checkout main`

- 8. Packages               ==> It would be nice to have a widget that shows what packages are able to be
                                updated and a terminal to update them or download things. In the Terminal I want to not have to write sudo pacman -S package so it would be great if I could just type system update or get [[Package]], but that is a very far stretch.
                                [[MOD+7]]
